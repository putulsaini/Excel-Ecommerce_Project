# Excel-Dashboard-for-Ecommerce-Analytics
For this project, I applied data cleaning methods to uncover and fix typos, misspellings, and errors within the dataset. I utilized pivot tables to efficiently generate comprehensive sales reports, enabling detailed analysis and insights. Additionally, I crafted pie charts, tables, graphs, and dashboards to illustrate sales growth and the most popular purchasing categories.
Some actions are performed i.e.,Data cleaning,Data processing,Data analytics,Data visualization,Presentation of report and Final insights based on calculations and observations

The final insights revealed several key trends. Women are more likely to buy compared to men, accounting for 65% of sales. Geographically, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka emerged as the top three states, contributing 35% of the sales. The adult age group (30-49) is the most significant contributor, making up 50% of the total sales. Among ecommerce channels, Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra were the most contributing, responsible for 80% of the sales.
